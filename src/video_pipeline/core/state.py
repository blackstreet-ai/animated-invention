"""Pipeline state definition.

This module defines :class:`PipelineState`, a single dataclass instance that
flows through the entire multi-agent pipeline.  Each ADK agent receives the
state, mutates its dedicated fields, and returns it to the orchestrator.

Why a *single* object?  It simplifies passing intermediate artifacts
between agents while allowing type checking and easy serialization.

Feel free to extend this schema as new data points become necessary (e.g.
transcription text, generated clip paths, etc.).  Downstream agents should
**never** rely on unknown attributesâ€”add them explicitly here with
documented purpose.
